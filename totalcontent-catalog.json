While incredibly useful to drive business productivity, this kind of unfettered web activity­ exposes organizations to a range of security and business risks, such as propagation of threats, possible data loss, and potential lack of compliance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, companies have used URL filtering as a tool to prevent employees from accessing unproductive sites. With today’s URL filtering, firms enable secure web access and protection from increasingly sophisticated threats, including malware and phishing sites.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EHow Does URL Filtering Work?\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EURL filtering technology compares all web traffic against a URL filtering database, permitting or denying access based on information contained therein. Each website defined in the database is assigned to a URL category, or group, that firms can utilize in one of two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Block or allow traffic based on URL category.\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Create a URL Filtering profile that specifies an action for each URL category and attach the profile to a policy. This includes categories for malware or phishing sites.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. Match traffic based on URL category for policy enforcement.\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;If the goal is for a specific policy rule to apply only to specific web traffic categories, add the category as match criteria when creating the policy rule.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ol\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EURL filtering&nbsp;is enabled through local database lookups, or by querying a master cloud­-based database. Local lookups on a limited, but frequently accessed, number of websites­ ensure maximum in-line performance and minimal latency for the most frequently­ accessed URLs, while cloud lookups provide coverage for the latest sites. To account for firms’ unique traffic patterns, on-device caches store the most recently accessed URLs, with the ability to also query a master database in the cloud for URL category­ information when an on-device URL is not found.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EStand-Alone URL Filtering Is Insufficient\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;Stand-alone URL filtering deployments, however, don’t have the right mechanisms to adequately control web browsing and prevent threats. They cannot coordinate actions and lack application visibility and meaningful integration with other required solutions to protect against the different attack stages and threat vectors. For example, phishing sites may be detected through an IPS or even a sandbox, but with stand-alone URL filtering, the lack of communication between sandbox, IPS and URL filtering technologies may result in inadequate protection of the URL request.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAn Integrated Approach to Prevention\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the incorporation of URL filtering into a natively integrated next-generation security platform, including threat analytics and intelligence to block both known and unknown threats, is required to adequately protect the network, endpoints and cloud services from tactics commonly used to bypass traditional security mechanisms.

Practically every business and government entity builds and maintains its own data center or has access to someone else's, if not both models. Many options are available today, such as renting servers at a colocation facility, using data center services managed by a third party, or using public cloud-based services from hosts like Amazon, Microsoft, Sony and Google.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Core Components of a Data Center\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EData center architectures and requirements can differ significantly. For example, a data center built for a cloud service provider like Amazon satisfies facility, infrastructure and security requirements that significantly differ from a completely private data center, such as one built for a government facility that is dedicated to securing classified data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of classification, an effective data center operation is achieved through a balanced investment in the facility and the equipment it houses. In addition, since data centers often house an organization's business-critical data and applications, it's essential that both facility and equipment are secured against intruders and&nbsp;cyberattacks.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe primary elements of a data center break down as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFacility&nbsp;\u003C/b\u003E– the usable space available for IT equipment.

Pricing is typically based on annual or monthly subscriptions, accounting for the software license, support and most other monetary costs. Popular SaaS apps include Office 365®, Box, G Suite®, Amazon Web Services (AWS®) and Salesforce®, among others. Providers often integrate with each other to augment productivity for customers. For example, a provider that offers an email application might store attachments in another provider’s cloud-based file storage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Value of SaaS - and Some of the Security Concerns\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe economics of SaaS – and cloud computing in general – empower enterprises. SaaS offers easy setup and collaboration capabilities that change the way organizations do business, allowing employees to access the tools they need to effectively do their jobs and essentially putting enterprise customers back in control of IT spending.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, while incredibly useful for driving business productivity, exponential growth in SaaS application usage brings with it security concerns much like those organizations face in traditional on-premises network infrastructure. For example, Microsoft OneDrive® or SharePoint® let users easily store and share files, but they create opportunities for accidental shares when users unintentionally send access to the wrong people.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, applications like Exchange and Salesforce easily store important, structured data for users, but these, too, are open to accidental data exposure or threat insertion risks and often act as entry points for malware, which can spread over time. For example, if a sales representative uploads an infected invoice document to Salesforce, a sales operations person who downloads the file will also become infected, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EReducing this type of risk in SaaS applications, where organizations’ most sensitive data often resides, is key to securing the enterprise IT infrastructures of the future. As a result, governance and protection of this data has catapulted to the top of CISOs’ priority lists.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Continued Evolution of SaaS Security – Enter SASE\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses have become increasingly concerned about the volume and sensitivity of data being transferred, stored and shared within SaaS environments beyond their visibility and control. As a result, a new approach to security has emerged, which Gartner calls the&nbsp;secure access service edge&nbsp;(SASE; pronounced “sassy”). A SASE is a single, cloud-delivered solution that combines networking (WAN, VPN, ZTNA) and network security services (FWaaS, CASB, DNS, DLP). A&nbsp;SASE architecture&nbsp;identifies users and devices, applies policy-based security, and delivers secure access to the appropriate application or data, allowing organizations to apply secure access no matter where their users, applications or devices are located.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA SASE solution provides organizations with many benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EProtection from threats across many thresholds: advanced threats, data loss, data theft and malware\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EReduced complexity and cost of deployment\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EComplete visibility, access and control over the entire network\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n"

Attackers commonly use phishing for credential theft, as it is a fairly cheap and extremely efficient tactic. The effectiveness of credential phishing relies on human interaction in an attempt to deceive employees, unlike malware and exploits, which rely on weaknesses in security defenses.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECorporate credential theft is usually a targeted effort. Attackers scour social media sites such as LinkedIn, searching for specific users whose credentials will grant access to critical data and information. The phishing emails and websites utilized in corporate credential theft are much more sophisticated than those used for consumer credential theft. Attackers put a great deal of effort into making these emails and websites look nearly identical to legitimate corporate applications and communications.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is in this phase of credential-based attacks that security awareness training plays a role as the first line of defense. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that employees will identify a phishing attempt 100 percent of the time. To minimize credential theft, corporate credentials should be limited to approved applications, and usage should be blocked from unlikely or unknown applications and sites. Security products be capable of blocking corporate credentials from ever leaving the organization’s network, and prevented from being submitted to malicious sites.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat is Credential Abuse?\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECredential abuse, the endgame of a credential-based attack, is the actual use of compromised passwords to authenticate applications and steal data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce an attacker gets ahold of user credentials and passwords, they can sell the credentials in the cybercrime underground or use them to compromise an organization’s network, bypassing all security measures to keep an adversary out, move laterally within the network and steal data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an unsegmented environment, an attacker can move freely across an organization’s network. If the environment is segregated and provides visibility across users and applications, security measures can be put in place to prevent an attacker from moving laterally and gaining access to critical data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce an attacker has the credentials to operate like a valid user, there is very little that can be done to identify an intruder and validate if that user is really the person their credentials claim them to be. Organizations commonly implement multi-factor authentication within applications to require users to validate their identity more than once. However, doing this for every individual application used within the organization is not scalable. Implementing policy-based, multi-factor authentication at the network layer, meaning in the firewall, will provide the needed scale and end-user ease of use.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Security Platform stops the credential-based attack lifecycle in multiple places, from the theft of credentials to the abuse of stolen credentials. The combined prevention capabilities of the Next-Generation Firewall, Threat Prevention, WildFire and URL Filtering stops known and unknown attacks used for the theft and abuse of credentials, while GlobalProtect extends protections from the platform to mobile workforces and provides additional measures to identify users and devices that are accessing applications.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"

Just as cloud computing has become one of the most common assets of the modern digital landscape, however, “cloud native” has become one of our most overused descriptors. So, what does the term really mean?&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDefining ‘Cloud Native’\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E“Cloud native” describes an approach to designing, implementing, deploying and operating applications while taking full advantage of the products and services offered by cloud service providers (CSPs).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, suppose a bank needs to create a new application. Before the rise of cloud computing, the bank would hire developers to build the app, purchase the physical infrastructure needed to run the application on-premises (i.e., on-site at corporate headquarters), and maintain that infrastructure throughout the application’s lifetime. To access the app, users would connect to the bank’s servers, and because those servers hosted each individual service provided by the app (looking up account numbers, transferring funds, etc.), updating and maintaining any one service would require shutting down the whole system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen developers first began hosting apps in the cloud, they were merely “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-hybrid-data-center\"\u003Elifting and shifting\u003C/a\u003E” those apps out of the on-premises environment while preserving the same overall architecture (and limitations). Instead of buying and managing servers to host their apps, they were renting compute resources from a CSP. However, a plethora of new services (e.g., platform as a service, containers as a service, serverless infrastructure) has opened up new opportunities to build, deploy and manage applications more quickly and efficiently than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, using a cloud native approach means making applications that are:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMicroservices-oriented:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Cloud native applications are composed of many individual services, called microservices.

A dynamic orchestration system automatically monitors each container, starting them up when users need them and shutting them down afterward, resulting in greater scalability and efficiency.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBenefits of Cloud Native Architecture\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA system in which applications comprise groups of microservices is known as a cloud native architecture. This offers numerous advantages over traditional “monolithic” application architectures.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EContainerization means individual services can be taken down without affecting the rest of the application. Dynamic orchestration enables easy, automated scalability by initiating or terminating duplicate instances of application services to match user needs. Loosely coupled microservices make all of this possible, breaking down complex, monolithic applications into smaller, simpler pieces.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is just a broad overview of cloud native architecture, which can come in many varieties.

Each router has a data plane, which holds the information, and a control plane, which tells the data where to go. Where data flows is typically determined by a network engineer or administrator who writes rules and policies, often manually, for each router on the network – a process that can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN separates the control and management processes from the underlying networking hardware, making them available as software that can be easily configured and deployed. A centralized control pane means network administrators can write new rules and policies, and then configure and deploy them across an entire network at once.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN makes it easier to manage and direct traffic across a network. With traditional networking approaches like MPLS, traffic created in the branch is returned, or “backhauled,” to a centralized internet security point in a headquarters data center. Backhauling traffic can lower application performance, which leads to reduced productivity and poor user experience. Because MPLS networks are private networks built for one given organization, they are considered reliable and secure, but they are expensive. Moreover, MPLS is not designed to handle the high volumes of WAN traffic that result from software-as-a-service, or SaaS, applications and cloud adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to traditional WANs, SD-WANs can manage multiple types of connections, including MPLS, broadband, LTE and others, as well as support applications hosted in data centers, public and private clouds, and SaaS services. SD-WAN can route application traffic over the best path in real time. In the case of cloud, SD-WAN can forward internet- and cloud-bound traffic to directly out the branch without backhauling.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBenefits of SD-WAN\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN offers many benefits to geographically distributed organizations, including:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplicity: Because each device is centrally managed, with routing based on application policies, WAN managers can create and update security rules in real time as network requirements change. In addition, combining SD-WAN with zero-touch provisioning – a feature that helps automate the deployment and configuration processes – organizations can further reduce the complexity, resources and opex required to turn up new sites.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImproved performance: By allowing efficient access to cloud-based resources without the need to backhaul traffic to centralized locations, organizations can provide better user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReduced costs: Network administrators can supplement or substitute expensive MPLS with broadband connectivity options.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n"

From one central point, the attacking party can command every computer on its botnet to simultaneously carry out a coordinated criminal action. The scale of a botnet (many comprised of millions of bots) enable the attacker to perform large-scale actions that were previously impossible with malware. Since botnets remain under control of a remote attacker, infected machines can receive updates and change their behavior on the fly. As a result, bot-herders are often able to rent access to segments of their botnet on the black market for significant financial gain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECommon botnet actions include:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEmail spam\u003C/b\u003E– though email is seen today as an older vector for attack, spam botnets are some of the largest in size. They are primarily used for sending out spam messages, often including malware, in towering numbers from each bot. The Cutwail botnet for example, can send up to 74 billion messages per day. They are also used to spread bots to recruit more computers to the botnet.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDDoS attacks\u003C/b\u003E– leverages the massive scale of the botnet to overload a target network or server with requests, rendering it inaccessible to its intended users. DDoS attacks target organizations for personal or political motives or to extort payment in exchange for ceasing the attack.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFinancial breach\u003C/b\u003E– includes botnets specifically designed for the direct theft of funds from enterprises and credit card information. Financial botnets, like the ZeuS botnet, have been responsible for attacks involving millions of dollars stolen directly from multiple enterprises over very short periods of time.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETargeted intrusions\u003C/b\u003E– smaller botnets designed to compromise specific high-value systems of organizations from which attackers can penetrate and intrude further into the network. These intrusions are extremely dangerous to organizations as attackers specifically target their most valuable assets, including financial data, research and development, intellectual property, and customer information.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBotnets are created when the bot-herder sends the bot from his command and control servers to an unknowing recipient using file sharing, email, or social media application protocols or other bots as an intermediary. Once the recipient opens the malicious file on his computer, the bot reports back to command and control where the bot-herder can dictate commands to infected computers. Below is a diagram illustrating these relationships:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of unique functional traits of bots and botnets make them well suited for long-term intrusions. Bots can be updated by the bot-herder to change their entire functionality based on what he/she would like for them to do and to adapt to changes and countermeasures by the target system. Bots can also utilize other infected computers on the botnet as communication channels, providing the bot-herder a near infinite number of communication paths to adapt to changing options and deliver updates. This highlights that infection is the most important step, because functionality and communication methods can always be changed later on as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs one of the most sophisticated types of modern malware, botnets are an immense cybersecurity concern to governments, enterprises, and individuals. Whereas earlier malware were a swarm of independent agents that simply infected and replicated themselves, botnets are centrally coordinated, networked applications that leverage networks to gain power and resilience. Since infected computers are under the control of the remote bot-herder, a botnet is like having a malicious hacker inside your network as opposed to just a malicious executable program.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"

For attackers to successfully complete an attack, they must progress through each stage. Blocking adversaries at any point in the cycle breaks the chain of attack. To protect a ­company’s network­ and data from attack, prevention must occur at each stage to block the attackers’ ability to access and move laterally within the organization or steal sensitive data. The following are the different stages of the attack lifecycle­ and steps that should be taken to prevent an attack at each stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Reconnaissance:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;During the first stage of the attack lifecycle, cyber adversaries carefully plan their method of attack. They research, identify and select targets that will allow them to meet their objectives. Attackers gather intel through publicly available sources, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and corporate websites. They will also scan for vulnerabilities that can be exploited within the target network, services, and applications, mapping out areas where they can take advantage. At this stage, attackers are looking for weaknesses based on the human and systems perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EPerform continuous inspection of network traffic flows to detect and prevent port scans and host sweeps.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EImplement security awareness training so users are mindful about what should and should not be posted – sensitive documents, customer lists, event attendees, job roles and responsibilities (i.e., using specific security tools within an organization), etc.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. Weaponization and Delivery:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Attackers will then determine which methods to use in order to deliver malicious payloads. Some of the methods they might utilize are automated tools, such as exploit kits, spear phishing attacks with malicious links, or attachments and malvertizing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EGain full visibility into all traffic, including SSL, and block high-risk applications.

Exploitation:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;In this stage, attackers deploy an exploit against a vulnerable application or system, typically using an exploit kit or weaponized document.

Installation:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Once they’ve established an initial foothold, attackers will install malware in order to conduct further operations, such as maintaining access, persistence and escalating privileges.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EPrevent malware installation, known or unknown, on the endpoint, network and cloud services.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EEstablish secure zones with strictly enforced user access controls and provide ongoing­ monitoring and inspection of all traffic between zones (Zero Trust model).\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELimit local admin access of users.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ETrain users to identify the signs of a malware infection and know how to follow up if something occurs.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E5. Command and Control:&nbsp;\u003C/b\u003EWith malware installed, attackers now own both sides of the connection: their malicious infrastructure and the infected machine. They can now actively control the system, instructing the next stages of attack. Attackers will establish a command channel in order to communicate and pass data back and forth between the infected devices and their own infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound command-and-control communications as well as file and data pattern­ uploads.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ERedirect malicious outbound communication to internal sinkholes to identify and block compromised hosts.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound communication to known malicious URLs through URL filtering.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ECreate a database of malicious domains to ensure global awareness and prevention through DNS monitoring.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELimit the attackers’ ability to move laterally with unknown tools and scripts by implementing­ granular control of applications to allow only authorized applications.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6. Actions on the Objective:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Now that the adversaries have control, persistence and ongoing communication, they will act upon their motivations in order to achieve their goal. This could be data exfiltration, destruction of critical infrastructure, to deface web property, or to create fear or the means for extortion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EProactively hunt for indicators of compromise on the network using threat intelligence­ tools.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBuild bridges between the security operations center (SOC) and the network operations­ center to put the right prevention-based controls in place.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EMonitor and inspect all traffic between zones and enforce user access controls for secure zones.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound command-and-control communications as well as file and data pattern­ uploads.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound communication to known malicious URLs through URL filtering.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EImplement granular control of applications and user control to enforce file transfer application­ policies on the enterprise, eliminating known archiving and transfer tactics and limiting the attackers’ ability to move laterally with unknown tools and scripts.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced attacks are very complex in that, in order for an adversary to succeed, they must progress through every stage of the attack lifecycle. If they cannot successfully take advantage of vulnerabilities, then they cannot install malware and will not be able to obtain command and control over the system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDisrupting the attack life cycle relies on not only the technology but the people and the process. The people must receive ongoing security awareness training and be educated in best practices to minimize the likelihood of an attack progressing past the first stage, and there must be processes and policies in place for remediation should an attacker successfully progress through the entire attack lifecycle.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECybersecurity is asymmetric warfare ­— an attacker must do everything right in order to succeed, but a network defender needs to only do one thing right to prevent an attack, of which they have multiple opportunities.

But what exactly is machine learning?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMachine learning\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;is when a program takes new data, learns from it and makes changes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machines perform data sequencing in an automated fashion, combing through sets of data searching for patterns and similarities. Once data patterns and predictive behaviors have been identified, rules must be implemented to take action on learned data. With machine learning, the machine is enabled to create or modify rules to further improve itself and accomplish its primary objectives.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe objectives can vary and have a variety of uses. Machine learning can be used to make routes faster and more efficient for various transportation methods; improve sales conversions through product recommendations or tailoring product content to direct purchasing decision; predict hospitalization based on physical behavior and patient data; improve patient diagnostics based on trends or areas of concern; or determining levels of risk for investments or insurance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the times before machine learning, a user must manually provide the program with new sets of rules for any new data in order for any action to occur, as well as decide on what the next step would be to act upon any new rules. With machine learning, the program creates algorithms, or a sequence of instructions, to execute in order to accomplish a desired end result as well as recommend and act upon any suggested next steps. Rather than having to manually parse through copious amounts of data, correlate patterns, create algorithms and execute across systems, users, utilizing automation and machine learning, have been able to improve efficiencies by being more granular and prescriptive, as well as alleviate workload.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EConditions for Machine Learning\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few conditions necessary for machine learning to occur:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EData must be consolidated into one place so the machine may be able to access all relevant data necessary to make a decision.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EThe appropriate structure must be in place to analyze the large amounts of data to identify similarities and patterns.

Watching artificial intelligence takeover movies such as&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/\"\u003EiRobot\u003C/a\u003E,&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"\u003EEx Machina\u003C/a\u003E,&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865957/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4\"\u003EWarGames\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;and&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"\u003ETron\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;will demonstrate this to an extend.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this fear is understandable, it’s important to note that machine learning helps predict behaviors and recognize patterns in a way that humans cannot due to their limited compute capacity. Machines are able to recognize patterns and act much faster than a human. They learn from previous and new conclusions to further develop and improve it’s own algorithms. When massive data sets are present, it is impossible to create algorithms at scale. The only way to do this is to utilize machine to process data and learn from experience to improve upon itself. Additionally, although machine learning enables self-implied changes in order to accomplish a specific objective, the objective itself is always set by humans. With this, there must also be an implied trust in the goal set by the user.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMachine Learning in Cybersecurity\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecific to&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-cyber-security\"\u003Ecybersecurity\u003C/a\u003E, it is difficult to keep pace with the constant volume and increasing sophistication of threats and attacks.

            "text": "\u003Cp\u003ETo understand why this is important, it’s necessary to think about how software security used to work. Traditionally, software security operations were performed separately from the other processes required to produce software. Developers wrote code, and IT teams deployed it without thinking much about security. It was only after software was written and placed in production environments that security engineers would check for potential vulnerabilities in the code or the environments hosting it.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach to software security is highly inefficient – especially in cloud environments, where the speed of deployment is accelerated. If a security problem were detected, it would often require withdrawing code that had already been written and deployed. This also meant problems often went undetected until after the software was already in production, leaving organizations exposed to security threats.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDevSecOps, aka&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2019/07/4-practical-steps-shift-left-security/\"\u003E“shift left”\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;security, addresses these problems by integrating security into all stages of the software delivery process. This ensures that developers think about security when they write code, that software is tested for security problems before it is deployed, and that IT teams have plans for addressing security issues quickly if they appear after deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDevSecOps Builds on DevOps\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nDevSecOps is not an alternative to DevOps. It simply extends the core concept behind DevOps – the idea that developers and IT teams should work together closely, instead of functioning separately, in silos – to include security. Effective DevSecOps means embracing DevOps and integrating security into the full&nbsp;CI/CD development pipeline.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDevSecOps Is a Culture, Not a Tool\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003C/b\u003EMany tools and processes can help an organization achieve DevSecOps, but ultimately, DevSecOps is not a specific tool or process. It’s a culture.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDevSecOps boils down to instilling the right cultural values in an organization. Developers, IT teams, security specialists and everyone else involved in software delivery must be on board with the idea that software security should be at the forefront of everything they do. Before making any decision related to an application, your entire team should think about the security implications.

Local lookups on a limited, but frequently accessed, number of websites­ ensure maximum in-line performance and minimal latency for the most frequently­ accessed URLs, while cloud lookups provide coverage for the latest sites. To account for firms’ unique traffic patterns, on-device caches store the most recently accessed URLs, with the ability to also query a master database in the cloud for URL category­ information when an on-device URL is not found.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EStand-Alone URL Filtering Is Insufficient\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;Stand-alone URL filtering deployments, however, don’t have the right mechanisms to adequately control web browsing and prevent threats. They cannot coordinate actions and lack application visibility and meaningful integration with other required solutions to protect against the different attack stages and threat vectors. For example, phishing sites may be detected through an IPS or even a sandbox, but with stand-alone URL filtering, the lack of communication between sandbox, IPS and URL filtering technologies may result in inadequate protection of the URL request.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAn Integrated Approach to Prevention\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the incorporation of URL filtering into a natively integrated next-generation security platform, including threat analytics and intelligence to block both known and unknown threats, is required to adequately protect the network, endpoints and cloud services from tactics commonly used to bypass traditional security mechanisms.

Attackers commonly use phishing for credential theft, as it is a fairly cheap and extremely efficient tactic. The effectiveness of credential phishing relies on human interaction in an attempt to deceive employees, unlike malware and exploits, which rely on weaknesses in security defenses.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECorporate credential theft is usually a targeted effort. Attackers scour social media sites such as LinkedIn, searching for specific users whose credentials will grant access to critical data and information. The phishing emails and websites utilized in corporate credential theft are much more sophisticated than those used for consumer credential theft. Attackers put a great deal of effort into making these emails and websites look nearly identical to legitimate corporate applications and communications.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is in this phase of credential-based attacks that security awareness training plays a role as the first line of defense. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that employees will identify a phishing attempt 100 percent of the time. To minimize credential theft, corporate credentials should be limited to approved applications, and usage should be blocked from unlikely or unknown applications and sites. Security products be capable of blocking corporate credentials from ever leaving the organization’s network, and prevented from being submitted to malicious sites.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat is Credential Abuse?\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECredential abuse, the endgame of a credential-based attack, is the actual use of compromised passwords to authenticate applications and steal data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce an attacker gets ahold of user credentials and passwords, they can sell the credentials in the cybercrime underground or use them to compromise an organization’s network, bypassing all security measures to keep an adversary out, move laterally within the network and steal data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an unsegmented environment, an attacker can move freely across an organization’s network. If the environment is segregated and provides visibility across users and applications, security measures can be put in place to prevent an attacker from moving laterally and gaining access to critical data.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce an attacker has the credentials to operate like a valid user, there is very little that can be done to identify an intruder and validate if that user is really the person their credentials claim them to be. Organizations commonly implement multi-factor authentication within applications to require users to validate their identity more than once. However, doing this for every individual application used within the organization is not scalable. Implementing policy-based, multi-factor authentication at the network layer, meaning in the firewall, will provide the needed scale and end-user ease of use.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Security Platform stops the credential-based attack lifecycle in multiple places, from the theft of credentials to the abuse of stolen credentials. The combined prevention capabilities of the Next-Generation Firewall, Threat Prevention, WildFire and URL Filtering stops known and unknown attacks used for the theft and abuse of credentials, while GlobalProtect extends protections from the platform to mobile workforces and provides additional measures to identify users and devices that are accessing applications.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"

Just as cloud computing has become one of the most common assets of the modern digital landscape, however, “cloud native” has become one of our most overused descriptors. So, what does the term really mean?&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDefining ‘Cloud Native’\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E“Cloud native” describes an approach to designing, implementing, deploying and operating applications while taking full advantage of the products and services offered by cloud service providers (CSPs).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, suppose a bank needs to create a new application. Before the rise of cloud computing, the bank would hire developers to build the app, purchase the physical infrastructure needed to run the application on-premises (i.e., on-site at corporate headquarters), and maintain that infrastructure throughout the application’s lifetime. To access the app, users would connect to the bank’s servers, and because those servers hosted each individual service provided by the app (looking up account numbers, transferring funds, etc.), updating and maintaining any one service would require shutting down the whole system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen developers first began hosting apps in the cloud, they were merely “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-hybrid-data-center\"\u003Elifting and shifting\u003C/a\u003E” those apps out of the on-premises environment while preserving the same overall architecture (and limitations). Instead of buying and managing servers to host their apps, they were renting compute resources from a CSP. However, a plethora of new services (e.g., platform as a service, containers as a service, serverless infrastructure) has opened up new opportunities to build, deploy and manage applications more quickly and efficiently than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, using a cloud native approach means making applications that are:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMicroservices-oriented:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Cloud native applications are composed of many individual services, called microservices.

A dynamic orchestration system automatically monitors each container, starting them up when users need them and shutting them down afterward, resulting in greater scalability and efficiency.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBenefits of Cloud Native Architecture\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA system in which applications comprise groups of microservices is known as a cloud native architecture. This offers numerous advantages over traditional “monolithic” application architectures.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EContainerization means individual services can be taken down without affecting the rest of the application. Dynamic orchestration enables easy, automated scalability by initiating or terminating duplicate instances of application services to match user needs. Loosely coupled microservices make all of this possible, breaking down complex, monolithic applications into smaller, simpler pieces.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is just a broad overview of cloud native architecture, which can come in many varieties.

For attackers to successfully complete an attack, they must progress through each stage. Blocking adversaries at any point in the cycle breaks the chain of attack. To protect a ­company’s network­ and data from attack, prevention must occur at each stage to block the attackers’ ability to access and move laterally within the organization or steal sensitive data. The following are the different stages of the attack lifecycle­ and steps that should be taken to prevent an attack at each stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Reconnaissance:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;During the first stage of the attack lifecycle, cyber adversaries carefully plan their method of attack. They research, identify and select targets that will allow them to meet their objectives. Attackers gather intel through publicly available sources, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and corporate websites. They will also scan for vulnerabilities that can be exploited within the target network, services, and applications, mapping out areas where they can take advantage. At this stage, attackers are looking for weaknesses based on the human and systems perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EPerform continuous inspection of network traffic flows to detect and prevent port scans and host sweeps.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EImplement security awareness training so users are mindful about what should and should not be posted – sensitive documents, customer lists, event attendees, job roles and responsibilities (i.e., using specific security tools within an organization), etc.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. Weaponization and Delivery:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Attackers will then determine which methods to use in order to deliver malicious payloads. Some of the methods they might utilize are automated tools, such as exploit kits, spear phishing attacks with malicious links, or attachments and malvertizing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EGain full visibility into all traffic, including SSL, and block high-risk applications.

Exploitation:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;In this stage, attackers deploy an exploit against a vulnerable application or system, typically using an exploit kit or weaponized document. This allows the attack to gain an initial entry point into the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock known and unknown vulnerability exploits on the endpoint.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EAutomatically deliver new protections globally to thwart follow-up attacks.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E4. Installation:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Once they’ve established an initial foothold, attackers will install malware in order to conduct further operations, such as maintaining access, persistence and escalating privileges.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EPrevent malware installation, known or unknown, on the endpoint, network and cloud services.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EEstablish secure zones with strictly enforced user access controls and provide ongoing­ monitoring and inspection of all traffic between zones (Zero Trust model).\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELimit local admin access of users.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ETrain users to identify the signs of a malware infection and know how to follow up if something occurs.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E5. Command and Control:&nbsp;\u003C/b\u003EWith malware installed, attackers now own both sides of the connection: their malicious infrastructure and the infected machine. They can now actively control the system, instructing the next stages of attack. Attackers will establish a command channel in order to communicate and pass data back and forth between the infected devices and their own infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound command-and-control communications as well as file and data pattern­ uploads.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ERedirect malicious outbound communication to internal sinkholes to identify and block compromised hosts.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound communication to known malicious URLs through URL filtering.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ECreate a database of malicious domains to ensure global awareness and prevention through DNS monitoring.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELimit the attackers’ ability to move laterally with unknown tools and scripts by implementing­ granular control of applications to allow only authorized applications.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6. Actions on the Objective:\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;Now that the adversaries have control, persistence and ongoing communication, they will act upon their motivations in order to achieve their goal. This could be data exfiltration, destruction of critical infrastructure, to deface web property, or to create fear or the means for extortion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EProactively hunt for indicators of compromise on the network using threat intelligence­ tools.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBuild bridges between the security operations center (SOC) and the network operations­ center to put the right prevention-based controls in place.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EMonitor and inspect all traffic between zones and enforce user access controls for secure zones.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound command-and-control communications as well as file and data pattern­ uploads.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBlock outbound communication to known malicious URLs through URL filtering.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EImplement granular control of applications and user control to enforce file transfer application­ policies on the enterprise, eliminating known archiving and transfer tactics and limiting the attackers’ ability to move laterally with unknown tools and scripts.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced attacks are very complex in that, in order for an adversary to succeed, they must progress through every stage of the attack lifecycle. If they cannot successfully take advantage of vulnerabilities, then they cannot install malware and will not be able to obtain command and control over the system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDisrupting the attack life cycle relies on not only the technology but the people and the process. The people must receive ongoing security awareness training and be educated in best practices to minimize the likelihood of an attack progressing past the first stage, and there must be processes and policies in place for remediation should an attacker successfully progress through the entire attack lifecycle.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECybersecurity is asymmetric warfare ­— an attacker must do everything right in order to succeed, but a network defender needs to only do one thing right to prevent an attack, of which they have multiple opportunities.

They all use some form of machine learning to automate data correlation, identify patterns, and make changes based on newly learned data. But what exactly is machine learning?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMachine learning\u003C/b\u003E&nbsp;is when a program takes new data, learns from it and makes changes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machines perform data sequencing in an automated fashion, combing through sets of data searching for patterns and similarities. Once data patterns and predictive behaviors have been identified, rules must be implemented to take action on learned data. With machine learning, the machine is enabled to create or modify rules to further improve itself and accomplish its primary objectives.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe objectives can vary and have a variety of uses. Machine learning can be used to make routes faster and more efficient for various transportation methods; improve sales conversions through product recommendations or tailoring product content to direct purchasing decision; predict hospitalization based on physical behavior and patient data; improve patient diagnostics based on trends or areas of concern; or determining levels of risk for investments or insurance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the times before machine learning, a user must manually provide the program with new sets of rules for any new data in order for any action to occur, as well as decide on what the next step would be to act upon any new rules. With machine learning, the program creates algorithms, or a sequence of instructions, to execute in order to accomplish a desired end result as well as recommend and act upon any suggested next steps. Rather than having to manually parse through copious amounts of data, correlate patterns, create algorithms and execute across systems, users, utilizing automation and machine learning, have been able to improve efficiencies by being more granular and prescriptive, as well as alleviate workload.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EConditions for Machine Learning\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few conditions necessary for machine learning to occur:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EData must be consolidated into one place so the machine may be able to access all relevant data necessary to make a decision.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EThe appropriate structure must be in place to analyze the large amounts of data to identify similarities and patterns. Combing through significant amounts of data sets requires powerful computational processing.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBasic set of rules must be provided to the machine to serve as a basic guideline, as well as provide the desired outcome.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ol\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Fear of Machine Learning\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe caveat with machine learning is the significant level of trust the user must place in the hands of the machine. There is a certain level of fear and trust associated when it comes to machine learning – a trust that the machine will take the appropriate actions, for instance putting their lives in the hands of the Tesla Autopilot or the Google self-driving vehicles – and a a fear machines might evolve into a technological singularity. Watching artificial intelligence takeover movies such as&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/\"\u003EiRobot\u003C/a\u003E,&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"\u003EEx Machina\u003C/a\u003E,&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865957/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4\"\u003EWarGames\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;and&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"\u003ETron\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;will demonstrate this to an extend.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this fear is understandable, it’s important to note that machine learning helps predict behaviors and recognize patterns in a way that humans cannot due to their limited compute capacity. Machines are able to recognize patterns and act much faster than a human. They learn from previous and new conclusions to further develop and improve it’s own algorithms. When massive data sets are present, it is impossible to create algorithms at scale. The only way to do this is to utilize machine to process data and learn from experience to improve upon itself. Additionally, although machine learning enables self-implied changes in order to accomplish a specific objective, the objective itself is always set by humans. With this, there must also be an implied trust in the goal set by the user.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMachine Learning in Cybersecurity\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecific to&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-cyber-security\"\u003Ecybersecurity\u003C/a\u003E, it is difficult to keep pace with the constant volume and increasing sophistication of threats and attacks.

WANs use links such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), wireless, broadband, virtual private networks (VPNs) and the internet to give users in remote offices access to corporate applications, services and resources, allowing them to carry out daily functions regardless of location. SD-WAN monitors the performance of WAN connections and manages traffic in an effort to maintain strong speeds as well as optimize connectivity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EHow Does SD-WAN Work?\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional WANs rely on physical routers to connect remote or branch users to applications hosted on data centers. Each router has a data plane, which holds the information, and a control plane, which tells the data where to go. Where data flows is typically determined by a network engineer or administrator who writes rules and policies, often manually, for each router on the network – a process that can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN separates the control and management processes from the underlying networking hardware, making them available as software that can be easily configured and deployed. A centralized control pane means network administrators can write new rules and policies, and then configure and deploy them across an entire network at once.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN makes it easier to manage and direct traffic across a network. With traditional networking approaches like MPLS, traffic created in the branch is returned, or “backhauled,” to a centralized internet security point in a headquarters data center. Backhauling traffic can lower application performance, which leads to reduced productivity and poor user experience. Because MPLS networks are private networks built for one given organization, they are considered reliable and secure, but they are expensive. Moreover, MPLS is not designed to handle the high volumes of WAN traffic that result from software-as-a-service, or SaaS, applications and cloud adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to traditional WANs, SD-WANs can manage multiple types of connections, including MPLS, broadband, LTE and others, as well as support applications hosted in data centers, public and private clouds, and SaaS services. SD-WAN can route application traffic over the best path in real time. In the case of cloud, SD-WAN can forward internet- and cloud-bound traffic to directly out the branch without backhauling.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBenefits of SD-WAN\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESD-WAN offers many benefits to geographically distributed organizations, including:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplicity: Because each device is centrally managed, with routing based on application policies, WAN managers can create and update security rules in real time as network requirements change. In addition, combining SD-WAN with zero-touch provisioning – a feature that helps automate the deployment and configuration processes – organizations can further reduce the complexity, resources and opex required to turn up new sites.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImproved performance: By allowing efficient access to cloud-based resources without the need to backhaul traffic to centralized locations, organizations can provide better user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReduced costs: Network administrators can supplement or substitute expensive MPLS with broadband connectivity options.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n"

            "text": "\u003Cp\u003ETo understand why this is important, it’s necessary to think about how software security used to work. Traditionally, software security operations were performed separately from the other processes required to produce software. Developers wrote code, and IT teams deployed it without thinking much about security. It was only after software was written and placed in production environments that security engineers would check for potential vulnerabilities in the code or the environments hosting it.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach to software security is highly inefficient – especially in cloud environments, where the speed of deployment is accelerated. If a security problem were detected, it would often require withdrawing code that had already been written and deployed. This also meant problems often went undetected until after the software was already in production, leaving organizations exposed to security threats.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDevSecOps, aka&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2019/07/4-practical-steps-shift-left-security/\"\u003E“shift left”\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;security, addresses these problems by integrating security into all stages of the software delivery process.

Developers, IT teams, security specialists and everyone else involved in software delivery must be on board with the idea that software security should be at the forefront of everything they do. Before making any decision related to an application, your entire team should think about the security implications.

From one central point, the attacking party can command every computer on its botnet to simultaneously carry out a coordinated criminal action. The scale of a botnet (many comprised of millions of bots) enable the attacker to perform large-scale actions that were previously impossible with malware. Since botnets remain under control of a remote attacker, infected machines can receive updates and change their behavior on the fly. As a result, bot-herders are often able to rent access to segments of their botnet on the black market for significant financial gain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECommon botnet actions include:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEmail spam\u003C/b\u003E– though email is seen today as an older vector for attack, spam botnets are some of the largest in size. They are primarily used for sending out spam messages, often including malware, in towering numbers from each bot. The Cutwail botnet for example, can send up to 74 billion messages per day. They are also used to spread bots to recruit more computers to the botnet.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDDoS attacks\u003C/b\u003E– leverages the massive scale of the botnet to overload a target network or server with requests, rendering it inaccessible to its intended users. DDoS attacks target organizations for personal or political motives or to extort payment in exchange for ceasing the attack.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFinancial breach\u003C/b\u003E– includes botnets specifically designed for the direct theft of funds from enterprises and credit card information. Financial botnets, like the ZeuS botnet, have been responsible for attacks involving millions of dollars stolen directly from multiple enterprises over very short periods of time.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETargeted intrusions\u003C/b\u003E– smaller botnets designed to compromise specific high-value systems of organizations from which attackers can penetrate and intrude further into the network. These intrusions are extremely dangerous to organizations as attackers specifically target their most valuable assets, including financial data, research and development, intellectual property, and customer information.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBotnets are created when the bot-herder sends the bot from his command and control servers to an unknowing recipient using file sharing, email, or social media application protocols or other bots as an intermediary. Once the recipient opens the malicious file on his computer, the bot reports back to command and control where the bot-herder can dictate commands to infected computers. Below is a diagram illustrating these relationships:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of unique functional traits of bots and botnets make them well suited for long-term intrusions. Bots can be updated by the bot-herder to change their entire functionality based on what he/she would like for them to do and to adapt to changes and countermeasures by the target system. Bots can also utilize other infected computers on the botnet as communication channels, providing the bot-herder a near infinite number of communication paths to adapt to changing options and deliver updates. This highlights that infection is the most important step, because functionality and communication methods can always be changed later on as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs one of the most sophisticated types of modern malware, botnets are an immense cybersecurity concern to governments, enterprises, and individuals. Whereas earlier malware were a swarm of independent agents that simply infected and replicated themselves, botnets are centrally coordinated, networked applications that leverage networks to gain power and resilience. Since infected computers are under the control of the remote bot-herder, a botnet is like having a malicious hacker inside your network as opposed to just a malicious executable program.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"

While incredibly useful to drive business productivity, this kind of unfettered web activity­ exposes organizations to a range of security and business risks, such as propagation of threats, possible data loss, and potential lack of compliance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, companies have used URL filtering as a tool to prevent employees from accessing unproductive sites.

Local lookups on a limited, but frequently accessed, number of websites­ ensure maximum in-line performance and minimal latency for the most frequently­ accessed URLs, while cloud lookups provide coverage for the latest sites. To account for firms’ unique traffic patterns, on-device caches store the most recently accessed URLs, with the ability to also query a master database in the cloud for URL category­ information when an on-device URL is not found.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EStand-Alone URL Filtering Is Insufficient\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;Stand-alone URL filtering deployments, however, don’t have the right mechanisms to adequately control web browsing and prevent threats. They cannot coordinate actions and lack application visibility and meaningful integration with other required solutions to protect against the different attack stages and threat vectors. For example, phishing sites may be detected through an IPS or even a sandbox, but with stand-alone URL filtering, the lack of communication between sandbox, IPS and URL filtering technologies may result in inadequate protection of the URL request.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAn Integrated Approach to Prevention\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the incorporation of URL filtering into a natively integrated next-generation security platform, including threat analytics and intelligence to block both known and unknown threats, is required to adequately protect the network, endpoints and cloud services from tactics commonly used to bypass traditional security mechanisms.

Pricing is typically based on annual or monthly subscriptions, accounting for the software license, support and most other monetary costs. Popular SaaS apps include Office 365®, Box, G Suite®, Amazon Web Services (AWS®) and Salesforce®, among others. Providers often integrate with each other to augment productivity for customers. For example, a provider that offers an email application might store attachments in another provider’s cloud-based file storage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Value of SaaS - and Some of the Security Concerns\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe economics of SaaS – and cloud computing in general – empower enterprises. SaaS offers easy setup and collaboration capabilities that change the way organizations do business, allowing employees to access the tools they need to effectively do their jobs and essentially putting enterprise customers back in control of IT spending.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, while incredibly useful for driving business productivity, exponential growth in SaaS application usage brings with it security concerns much like those organizations face in traditional on-premises network infrastructure. For example, Microsoft OneDrive® or SharePoint® let users easily store and share files, but they create opportunities for accidental shares when users unintentionally send access to the wrong people.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, applications like Exchange and Salesforce easily store important, structured data for users, but these, too, are open to accidental data exposure or threat insertion risks and often act as entry points for malware, which can spread over time. For example, if a sales representative uploads an infected invoice document to Salesforce, a sales operations person who downloads the file will also become infected, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EReducing this type of risk in SaaS applications, where organizations’ most sensitive data often resides, is key to securing the enterprise IT infrastructures of the future. As a result, governance and protection of this data has catapulted to the top of CISOs’ priority lists.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Continued Evolution of SaaS Security – Enter SASE\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses have become increasingly concerned about the volume and sensitivity of data being transferred, stored and shared within SaaS environments beyond their visibility and control. As a result, a new approach to security has emerged, which Gartner calls the&nbsp;secure access service edge&nbsp;(SASE; pronounced “sassy”). A SASE is a single, cloud-delivered solution that combines networking (WAN, VPN, ZTNA) and network security services (FWaaS, CASB, DNS, DLP). A&nbsp;SASE architecture&nbsp;identifies users and devices, applies policy-based security, and delivers secure access to the appropriate application or data, allowing organizations to apply secure access no matter where their users, applications or devices are located.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA SASE solution provides organizations with many benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EProtection from threats across many thresholds: advanced threats, data loss, data theft and malware\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EReduced complexity and cost of deployment\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EComplete visibility, access and control over the entire network\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n"
